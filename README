Vortex_Id : A 2D vortex Identification Code

The objective of this code is to provide a way to systematically identify,
count and raise statistics of vortical structures in turbulent flow.

The input is a 2D velocity field, which can either be a true 2D flow or a 
cross cut from a 3D velocity field. As of the present moment, this flows include
synthetic 2D flows used to validate the identification part of the code and, 
ongoing, input from openFOAM files.
